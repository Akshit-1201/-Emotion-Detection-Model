# -Emotion-Detection-Model
Using Convolution Neural Network (CNN), we aim to develop a machine learning model which can classify images of humans based on 7 emotions (angry, fear, disgust, happy, neutral, sad, surprise). We will be going about this by training the data with the help of a dataset, containing images of people, and the emotion portrayed by them.
